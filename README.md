# _boilerplate

A Work in Progress

TODO

* Write vendor paths to index in gulpfile for easy version updates
* Update dependency install instructions and links in README
* Update alternative gulfile JS for common scenarios

## The Why

While I understand the appeal of fancy tooling and frameworks, my development philosophy is to only use them when needed. Most websites don't require anything on the backend and static websites are cheaper to host. Static sites are also a great entry point for starting to use serverless development, which as an MBA I prefer on principle.

Additional development philosophies baked into this boilerplate are to use simple to learn tooling and to not reinvent the wheel. This is what drove the decision to use Bootstrap/Gulp/SASS, as they have excellent development features out of the box, are relatively easy to understand, and have great documentation with a development community to help you get started.

## Requirements

To start using this boilerplate template, you will need the following:

### Node.js

TODO: Add install instructions.

### Gulp

TODO: Add install instructions.

## Usage

This is a simple and slightly opinionated static HTML site boilerplate template built to use Gulp, Bootstrap, and SASS. Template gulpfiles are available for standard use cases by yours truly.

### Getting Started

1. Fork repo and copy into new development folder.
2. (Optional) Update gulpfile with appropriate template.
3. Update package.json with project information.
4. (Optional) Update favicon in _src/img folder with your own branding.
5. Start developing your static site in the _src folder. :)
6. Run Gulp to package your site.
7. Publish your static site from the _dist folder.

### Getting updated

Das it.
Just run your site locally or on a staging server to verify that package updates didn't break anything.
